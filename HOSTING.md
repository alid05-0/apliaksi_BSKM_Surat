## Option 1: Host Locally

You can run the application locally using the provided scripts:

## Option 2: Host on GitHub Pages (Free Public Hosting)

1. Create a GitHub repository for your project if you don't have one.

2. Push your project files (`index.html`, `Logo BKSM (1).png`, etc.) to the repository.

3. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings** > **Pages**.

4. Under **Source**, select the branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and the root folder (`/root`).

5. Save the settings. GitHub will provide a URL where your site is hosted.

6. Access your site via the provided URL.

## Option 3: Host on Netlify or Vercel

You can also use services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host your static site easily:

- Connect your GitHub repository.

- Deploy the site with default settings.

- Your site will be live on a public URL.

## Notes

- This application is a static frontend app and does not require a backend server.

- User data is stored in the browser's localStorage.

- For production use, consider adding backend support for user authentication and data persistence.
